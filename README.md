# Machine Learning Housing Prices with R

This project is an introductory competition on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) for machine learning regression, the purpose of which is to model housing prices according to individual housing features.

The final R script that was used for submission can be found at:
